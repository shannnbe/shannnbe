### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Gloria Shanti**, often called **Shan**. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student residing in Jakarta, Indonesia.
I have a great interest in Data Science, especially in **Machine Learning**, I have also grown an interest in **Mobile App Development** using **Kotlin/Java**.

I have recently started using GitHub to build my portfolio (hence why it looked so dry)...
If you want to know me more you can check out my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gloria-shanti-wulandaru-a0ab21216/)**.
Thank you!

If you ever want to reach me, you can contact me via [Email](contactme.gloriashanti@gmailcom) ðŸ˜¸
